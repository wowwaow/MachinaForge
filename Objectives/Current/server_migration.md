- All configuration procedures are temporarily suspended
- Await new secure configuration procedures from security team
- Current credentials are compromised and must be rotated
- Follow incident response procedures

### Overview
This section will be updated with new secure configuration procedures after the security incident is resolved. Contact the security team for interim procedures.

### Configuration Security Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **RESTRICTED: SECURITY TEAM ACCESS REQUIRED**
