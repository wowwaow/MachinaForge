# Machina Server Migration to Hetzner
Priority Level: HIGH
Created: 2025-06-01T19:40:01Z
Status: In Progress

## Objective Description
Migration of the Machina system infrastructure to Hetzner cloud hosting platform to improve performance, reliability, and scalability of our operations.

## Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [x] Document current system architecture
- [x] Inventory all services and dependencies
- [ ] Create backup of all critical data
- [x] Select appropriate Hetzner server specifications (see Server Specifications section)
- [x] Document network requirements and security policies

## Server Specifications
### Minimum Requirements (Based on Current Usage + Growth Buffer)
- CPU: 8 vCPU cores (current load is low, but needed for concurrent agent operations)
- RAM: 32GB (current usage: 15.9GB, buffer for growth and Docker containers)
- Storage: 400GB NVMe (current usage: 196GB, double for backups and growth)
- Network: 1 Gbps connection

### Recommended Hetzner Instance
- Instance Type: CCX42 or Equivalent
  - 8 vCPU cores
  - 32GB RAM
  - 400GB NVMe Storage
  - Dedicated Network Performance
  
### Additional Requirements
- Backup Space: 200GB minimum
- Snapshot Support
- Regular Backups
- Monitoring Integration
- DDoS Protection

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Provision new Hetzner server
- [ ] Configure network security groups
- [ ] Set up VPN access
- [ ] Install base system requirements
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging systems

### Phase 3: Migration
- [ ] Set up development/staging environment
- [ ] Migrate database systems
- [ ] Transfer application codebase
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Test all system components
- [ ] Update DNS records
- [ ] Perform initial performance testing

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive system tests
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Validate security configurations
- [ ] Document any issues or discrepancies

### Phase 5: Cutover
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Final data synchronization
- [ ] Update DNS records
- [ ] Verify all services operational
- [ ] Monitor system performance

## Success Criteria
1. Zero data loss during migration
2. Minimal service disruption
3. All system components operational
4. Improved or equal performance metrics
5. Updated documentation completed
6. Backup and recovery procedures verified
7. Security protocols validated

## Risk Assessment
- Data loss or corruption during transfer
- Extended downtime during cutover
- Network connectivity issues
- Security vulnerabilities during transition
- Dependencies compatibility issues

## Contingency Plan
1. Maintain original system until new setup is fully validated
2. Prepare rollback procedures for each phase
3. Keep detailed logs of all changes
4. Multiple backup points during migration

## Timeline
- Expected Start Date: 2025-06-01
- Estimated Completion: 2025-06-15

## Resource Requirements
- System Administrator access
- Hetzner cloud credentials
- VPN access
- Backup storage capacity
- Testing environment
- Documentation tools
