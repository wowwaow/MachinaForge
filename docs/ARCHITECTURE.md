# 🏗️ MachinaForge System Architecture

## System Overview

MachinaForge is built as a distributed multi-agent system with a focus on modularity, resilience, and intelligent task management. This document outlines the core architectural components and their interactions.

### Core Components

1. **Task Detection System**
   - Monitors system for new tasks
   - Classifies and prioritizes tasks
   - Routes tasks to appropriate queues

2. **Agent Coordinator**
   - Manages agent lifecycle
   - Handles role assignments
   - Coordinates inter-agent communication

3. **Resource Manager**
   - Allocates system resources
   - Monitors resource utilization
   - Implements load balancing

4. **Execution Engine**
   - Processes task workflows
   - Manages task dependencies
   - Handles task completion and failure

5. **Health Monitor**
   - Tracks system vitals
   - Implements fault detection
   - Triggers recovery procedures
