## Deployment Package

### Deployment Package Integrity

#### Critical Files
The deployment package includes the following critical files that require integrity verification:

1. Configuration Files

   - services/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
   - docker-compose.yml

2. Dockerfiles
   - services/php/Dockerfile
   - services/nginx/Dockerfile

3. Configuration Files
   - services/php/php.ini

4. Deployment Scripts
   - scripts/deploy.sh
   - scripts/install_docker.sh
   - scripts/setup.sh

#### Integrity Verification
1. Download the official checksum file from the secure artifact repository
2. Verify the checksum file's signature using the security team's public key
3. Run the verification script from the deployment tools:
   ```bash
   ./verify_integrity.sh machina_hetzner_deploy.tar.gz
   ```

IMPORTANT: Do not proceed with deployment if integrity verification fails. Contact the security team immediately if discrepancies are found.

### Deployment Scripts
- setup.sh: System preparation and basic configuration
- install_docker.sh: Docker environment setup
- deploy.sh: Service deployment and configuration

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
