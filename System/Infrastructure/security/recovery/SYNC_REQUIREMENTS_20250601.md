- [ ] Confirm service status
- [ ] Check configuration integrity
- [ ] Validate database state

### 3. Access Verification
- [ ] Test new credentials
- [ ] Verify service authentication
- [ ] Confirm API access
- [ ] Validate integration points

## System Readiness Checklist

### Pre-Sync Requirements
1. Security Clearance
   - [ ] Written security team approval
   - [ ] Incident closure confirmation
   - [ ] Access log verification
   - [ ] System integrity confirmation

2. Infrastructure Readiness
   - [ ] Server availability confirmed
   - [ ] Network connectivity verified

### 2. Alert Configuration
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Sync operation failures
- System anomalies
- Service disruptions

### 3. Reporting Requirements
- Hourly status updates
- Operation completion reports
- Error notifications
- Security event logging

## Post-Recovery Validation

### 1. Success Criteria
